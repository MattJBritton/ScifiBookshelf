The Moon,"Somnium: The Dream, or Posthumous Work on Lunar Astronomy",Johannes Kepler,1634,"Somnium (Latin for ""The Dream"") is a fantasy written between 1620 and 1630 by Johannes Kepler in which a student of Tycho Brahe is transported to the Moon by occult forces. It presents a detailed imaginative description of how the earth might look when viewed from the moon, and is considered the first serious scientific treatise on lunar astronomy. Carl Sagan and Isaac Asimov have referred to it as the first work of science fiction.  Somnium began as a student dissertation in which Kepler defended the Copernican doctrine of the motion of the Earth, suggesting that an observer on the Moon would find the planet's movements as clearly visible as the Moon's activity is to the Earth's inhabitants. Nearly 20 years later, Kepler added the dream framework, and after another decade, he drafted a series of explanatory notes reflecting upon his turbulent career and the stages of his intellectual development. The book was edited by his heirs, including Jacob Bartsch, after Kepler's death in 1630, and was published posthumously in 1634.",229,5984974,0.079262147,0.417508558

The Moon,The Consolidator,Daniel Defoe,1705,"Daniel Defoe was a writer, journalist and spy. He is known for being one of the first authors to write a novel.

Mars,The Speedy Journey,"Eberhard Christian Kindermann, Dwight R Decker",1744,"On July 10, 1744, a German astronomer named Eberhard Christian Kindermann thought he had made the discovery of a lifetime - a never before seen moon orbiting the planet Mars, more than 130 years before any were officially observed. Instead of announcing his discovery the usual way, Kindermann chose to dramatize it by writing a story about an interplanetary voyage to his alleged Martian moon. The result was The Speedy Journey on the Air-Ship to the Upper World, perhaps the first story ever written about a trip to Mars (or at least somewhere close by). By turns quirky and even bizarre, the story is still astonishing today for its sheer imagination as a work of pioneering science fiction. Besides traveling through space and encountering alien life forms on another world, Kindermann's heroes even use balloons for aerial transportation nearly forty years before the actual first balloon flight in 1783. Never before translated into English, little known outside its native country, and usually relegated to uncertain references in footnotes and bibliographies, The Speedy Journey is now available after 270 years to science-fiction fans and historians, astronomy buffs, and everyone else in ""the curious lower world,"" as the author would have said. This edition includes the complete translated text of the original story as well as essays by science-fiction historian John J. Pierce and translator Dwight R. Decker that put it in the context of its time. The cover by Alan Fletcher Bradford and new illustrations by Donna Barr are supplemented with vintage illustrations from E. C. Kindermann's own works.",124,23326717,0.08361014,0.435431235
"Jupiter, Saturn",Micromegas,"Voltaire, Theo Cuff",1752,"The story is organized into seven brief chapters. The first describes MicromÃ©gas (small/large), an inhabitant of one of the planets that orbits Sirius. His home world is 21.6 million times greater in circumference than the Earth. MicromÃ©gas stands 120,000 feet (37 km) tall. When he is almost 450 years old, approaching the end of his infancy, MicromÃ©gas writes a scientific book examining the insects on his planet, which at 100 feet (30 m) are too small to be detected by ordinary microscopes. This book is considered heresy, and after a 200-year trial, he is banished from the court for a term of 800 years. MicromÃ©gas takes this as an incentive to travel around the Universe in a quest to develop his intellect and his spirit. After extensive celestial travels he arrives on Saturn, where he befriends the secretary of the Academy of Saturn, a man less than a twentieth of his size (a ""dwarf"" standing only 6,000 feet (1.8 km) tall). They discuss the differences between their planets. The Saturnian has 72 senses while the Sirian has 1,000. The Saturnian lives for 15,000 Earth years while the Sirian lives for 10.5 million years; MicromÃ©gas reports that he has visited worlds where people live much longer than this, but still consider their lifespans too short. At the end of their conversation, they decide to take a philosophical journey together. Eventually, they arrive on Earth and circumnavigate it in 36 hours, with the Saturnian only getting his lower legs wet in the deepest ocean and the Sirian barely wetting his ankles. They decide that the planet must be devoid of life, since it is too small for them to see with the naked eye. In the Baltic Sea, the Saturnian happens to spot a tiny speck swimming about, and he picks it up to discover that it is a whale. As they examine it, a boatful of philosophers returning from an Arctic voyage happens to run aground nearby. The space travellers examine the boat and, upon discovering the lifeforms inside it, they conclude that the tiny beings are too small to be of any intelligence or spirit. Yet they gradually realize the beings are speaking to each other, and they devise a hearing tube with the clippings of their fingernails in order to hear the tiny voices. After listening for a while, they learn the human language and begin a conversation, wherein they are shocked to discover the breadth of the human intellect. The final chapter sees the humans testing the philosophies of Aristotle, Descartes, Malebranche, Leibniz and Locke against the travellers' wisdom. When the travellers hear the theory of Aquinas that the universe was made uniquely for mankind, they fall into an enormous fit of laughter. Taking pity on the humans, the Sirian decides to write them a book that will explain the point of everything to them. When the volume is presented to the Academy of Science in Paris, the secretary opens the book only to find blank pages.",38,1156110,0.076461153,0.532430066

Our rocket ship gets shot out of a cannon? To the moon? Goodness!

Apollo 11 had a three-person crew, just as Verne's did; and both blasted off from the American state of Florida. Even the return to earth happened in more-or-less the same place.

Lovecraft has become a cult figure in the horror genre and is noted as creator of the ""Cthulhu Mythos,"" a series of loosely interconnected fictions featuring a ""pantheon"" of nonhuman creatures, as well as the famed Necronomicon, a grimoire of magical rites and forbidden lore. His works typically had a tone of ""cosmic pessimism,"" regarding mankind as insignificant and powerless in the universe. Lovecraft's readership was limited during his life, and his works, particularly early in his career, have been criticized as occasionally ponderous, and for their uneven quality.

Garth had better be quick because while he managed to go on the lam, Alice was not so lucky; she was arrested, tried, convicted, and faces the death penalty in just three weeks.

Ganymede,Christmas on Ganymede,Isaac Asimov,1942,"As the title indicates, the story is set on the Jovian moon Ganymede, the first story by Asimov set on that world. In the story, Ganymede has an oxygen atmosphere (which is not quite breathable by humans), and its own native flora and fauna, including a moderately intelligent native race, called Ossies for their resemblance to ostriches. There is a human settlement on Ganymede which is run by the Ganymedan Products Corporation, which exports wolframite, karen leaves, and oxite to Earth, and which employs the Ossies as a labor force.  The humans on Ganymede face a crisis caused by Olaf Johnson, who was inspired by the impending Christmas season to tell the Ossies about Santa Claus. Now the Ossies want a visit from Santa, and they refuse to work until they get one. This will cause Ganymedan Products to fall short of its quota, costing the company its franchise on Ganymede, and costing its employees their jobs. Scott Pelham, the Commander of the base, orders his men to stage a visit by Santa, with Johnson in the starring role. A flying sleigh is built out of gravo-repulsors and compressed air jets, and eight local animals called spinybacks, after being dosed with brandy to keep them docile, are harnessed to it to serve as reindeer. Johnson, dressed vaguely like Santa, manages to fly the contraption to a crude lodge where the Ossies are waiting for him. He leaves Christmas tree ornaments in their stockings, which the Ossies take to be Santa Claus eggs. All seems well, until the Ossies demand a visit from Santa every year, and one of the men realizes they mean once every Ganymedan revolution, which is just over seven Earth days.",18,24438213,0.0125,0.610984848

Only the chance that places a drifting alien ship in his path saves him from certain doom.  Unfortunately for poor Red, the ship is the last refuge of the imperialistic and cruel Rakshi, highly advanced aliens who see in Red a guide who can take them to some refuge in the Solar System. There the Rakshi can rebuild, recover, and expand to conquer an unsuspecting Solar System.  And then thereâ€™s the dame, the first person to treat Red as though he was a personâ€_.

"Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn","That Hideous Strength (Space Trilogy, #3)",C.S. Lewis,1945,"Written during the dark hours immediately before and during the Second World War, C. S. Lewis's Space Trilogy, of which That Hideous Strength is the third volume, stands alongside such works as Albert Camus's The Plague and George Orwell's 1984 as a timely parable that has become timeless, beloved by succeeding generations as much for the sheer wonder of its storytelling as for the significance of its moral concerns. For the trilogy's central figure, C. S. Lewis created perhaps the most memorable character of his career, the brilliant, clear-eyed, and fiercely brave philologist Dr. Elwin Ransom. Appropriately, Lewis modeled Dr. Ransom on his dear friend J. R. R. Tolkien, for in the scope of its imaginative achievement and the totality of its vision of not one but two imaginary worlds, the Space Trilogy is rivaled in this century only by Tolkien's trilogy The Lord of the Rings. Readers who fall in love with Lewis's fantasy series The Chronicles of Narnia as children unfailingly cherish his Space Trilogy as adults; it, too, brings to life strange and magical realms in which epic battles are fought between the forces of light and those of darkness. But in the many layers of its allegory, and the sophistication and piercing brilliance of its insights into the human condition, it occupies a place among the English language's most extraordinary works for any age, and for all time.In That Hideous Strength, the final installment of the Space Trilogy, the dark forces that have been repulsed in Out of the Silent Planet and Perelandra are massed for an assault on the planet Earth itself. Word is on the wind that the mighty wizard Merlin has come back to the land of the living after many centuries, holding the key to ultimate power for the force that can find him and bend him to its will. A sinister technocratic organization that is gaining force throughout England, N.I.C.E. (the National Institute of Coordinated Experiments), secretly controlled by humanity's mortal enemies, plans to use Merlin in their plot to ""recondition"" society. Dr. Ransom forms a countervailing group, Logres, in opposition, and the two groups struggle to a climactic resolution that brings the Space Trilogy to a magnificent, crashing close.",534,100933,0.217982456,0.578508772

Venus,Enchantress of Venus,Leigh Brackett,1949,"Few men have gone beyond that barrier, into the vast mystery of Inner Venus. Fewer still have come back.First published in Planet Stories (1949) The ship moved slowly across the Red Sea, through the shrouding veils of mist, her sail barely filled by the languid thrust of the wind. Her hull, of a thin light metal, floated without sound, the surface of the strange ocean parting before her prow in silent rippling streamers of flame.Night deepened toward the ship, a river of indigo flowing out of the west. The man known as Stark stood alone by the after rail and watched its coming. He was full of impatience and a gathering sense of danger, so that it seemed to him that even the hot wind smelled of it.The steersman lay drowsily over his sweep. He was a big man, with skin and hair the color of milk. He did not speak, but Stark felt that now and again the man's eyes turned toward him, pale and calculating under half-closed lids, with a secret avarice.The captain and the two other members of the little coasting vessel's crew were forward, at their evening meal. Once or twice Stark heard a burst of laughter, half-whispered and furtive. It was as though all four shared in some private joke, from which he was rigidly excluded.The heat was oppressive. Sweat gathered on Stark's dark face. His shirt stuck to his back. The air was heavy with moisture, tainted with the muddy fecundity of the land that brooded westward behind the eternal fog.There was something ominous about the sea itself. Even on its own world, the Red Sea is hardly more than legend. It lies behind the Mountains of White Cloud, the great barrier wall that hides away half a planet. Few men have gone beyond that barrier, into the vast mystery of Inner Venus. Fewer still have come back.Stark was one of that handful. Three times before he had crossed the mountains, and once he had stayed for nearly a year. But he had never quite grown used to the Red Sea.It was not water. It was gaseous, dense enough to float the buoyant hulls of the metal ships, and it burned perpetually with its deep inner fires. The mists that clouded it were stained with the bloody glow. Beneath the surface Stark could see the drifts of flame where the lazy currents ran, and the little coiling bursts of sparks that came upward and spread and melted into other bursts, so that the face of the sea was like a cosmos of crimson stars.It was very beautiful, glowing against the blue, luminous darkness of the night. Beautiful, and strange.There was a padding of bare feet, and the captain, Malthor, came up to Stark, his outlines dim and ghostly in the gloom.""We will reach Shuruun,"" he said, ""before the second glass is run.""Stark nodded. ""Good.""The voyage had seemed endless, and the close confinement of the narrow deck had got badly on his nerves.""You will like Shuruun,"" said the captain jovially. ""Our wine, our food, our womenall superb. We don't have many visitors. We keep to ourselves, as you will see. But those who do come""He laughed, and clapped Stark on the shoulder. ""Ah, yes. You will be happy in Shuruun!""It seemed to Stark that he caught an echo of laughter from the unseen crew, as though they listened and found a hidden jest in Malthor's words.Stark said, ""That's fine.""""Perhaps,"" said Malthor, ""you would like to lodge with me. I could make you a good price.""He had made a good price for Stark's passage from up the coast. An exorbitantly good one.Stark said, ""No.""""You don't have to be afraid,"" said the Venusian, in a confidential tone. ""The strangers who come to Shuruun all have the same reason. It's a good place to hide. We're out of everybody's reach.""He paused, but Stark did not rise to his bait. Presently he chuckled and went on, ""In fact, it's such a safe place that most of the strangers decide to stay on. Now, at my house, I could give you""",70,12122847,-0.001920034,0.496359604

Venus,"Farewell, Fantastic Venus! A History Of The Planet Venus In Fact And Fiction",Brian W. Aldiss,1968,"Farewell Fantastic Venus is a science fiction anthology edited by Brian Aldiss and Harry Harrison. It was first published in 1968 as a direct response to the information returned from the first space probes sent to Venus, especially the first atmospheric probe to return data, Venera 4. The first data was not returned from the surface until Venera 7 successfully landed in 1970. The book contains stories and novel excerpts from the time before Venus' true nature became apparent, when the clouded planet could still be imagined as another Earth, albeit a hotter one. From that point on, few stories would be written which did not recognize Venus as a dry lifeless world with acid clouds and a temperature high enough to melt lead. Writers such as Larry Niven (author of ""Becalmed in Hell"") did write about the ""new"" Venus, but there were to be few more transplanted jungle adventures, imagined world of oceans with monsters, or Venusians. Venus had been the best hope for extraterrestrial life, and now that hope was lost. Later, however, writers avoided this apparent impasse through using hard science fiction premises for future terraforming of Venus, or resorted to alternate world science fiction, where Venus had either been terraformed by aliens in the distant past to provide an earth-like biosphere, or had undergone different processes of planetary formation to arrive at an inhabitable alternative. Alternatively, science fantasy authors deliberately overlooked recent discoveries in favor of a setting they loved. The authors whose stories were included ranged from C.S. Lewis (excerpt from Perelandra) to Edgar Rice Burroughs (excerpt from Pirates of Venus) and from Olaf Stapledon (excerpt from Last and First Men) to Poul Anderson (The Big Rain, Sister Planet).

Fifty million years after the events in The Peace War, small groups of humans have survived by bobbling themselves in stasis for hundreds of thousands of years at a time. With less than 300 humans left alive and invaluable high-tech devices inevitably breaking down, a long-term plan must be implemented to ensure humankind's survival. Those who remain alive, however, are bitterly divided. When one of the leading planners, Marta Korolev, is cruelly murdered (she is left alone in realtime while everyone else spends centuries in stasis), a former police officer must somehow figure out who the culprit is before the human race is wiped out forever.

What mankind does not know is that God did not create man on Earth, but rather on MARS! When Mars could not sustain life anymore, mankind had to escape the planet and colonized Earth. Many years later, a study was written about the survival of mankind in Sol Four (Mars) and its struggle in Sol Three (Earth). We proved to be a species that has survived wars, slavery and other forms of abuse -- always holding on to our faith in God.Doctor Ajidn Edejm, after finding out that his world was going to die, embarks in the dangerous mission to rescue as many people as possible and search for a new world. All the while, the government wants to keep everything quiet and even kill him for telling others about the unavoidable doom. ""We discovered that the seismic activity is increasing and becoming more frequent causing volcanic eruptions, which increase the volume of sulfates in the atmosphere and break down Ozone. In other words, the atmosphere of this planet is bleeding into space. At the rate these phenomena are taking place, life on Trr will no longer be supported in less than a month's time. The only way for our species to survive is to travel to another habitable planet. In our research, we have found a planet close to ours with a similar atmosphere about three months away. We have prepared a fleet of ships to take as many citizens as possible to this new planet. We will gather in three days' time, on the fields of the Theli State Government University, scientists and other experts along with some clergy will welcome you."" -- Doctor Ajidn Edejm (copyright, 2012, 2013)Years before the extinction of life in Mars, the Thelian society was perfect, yet corrupted.

The project was scuttled, however, when a fearful public branded the supersoldiers dangerous mutants, dooming the Thirteens to forced exile on Earths distant, desolate Mars colony. But Marsalis found a way to slip backand into a lucrative living as a bounty hunter and hit man before a police sting landed him in prisona fate worse than Mars, and much more dangerous.Luckily, his enhanced life also seems to be a charmed one. A new chance at freedom beckons, courtesy of the government. All Marsalis has to do is use his superior skills to bring in another fugitive. But this one is no common criminal. Hes another Thirteenone whos already shanghaied a space shuttle, butchered its crew, and left a trail of bodies in his wake on a bloody cross-country spree. And like his pursuer, he was bred to fight to the death. Still, theres no question Marsalis will take the job. Though it will draw him deep into violence, treachery, corruption, and painful confrontation with himself, anything is better than remaining a prisoner. The real question is: can he remain saneand alivelong enough to succeed?2007 1st Ed Del Rey 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1",544,40448,-0.008976125,0.490955005

Jupiter,The Intrepid: Earth's Moment of Awareness,Michael James Wilson,2008,"The Intrepid, Earth's moment of awareness is a science fiction novel about a mining and cruise ship that arrives in the solar system 48,000 years in the future. The approach of Loop I has compressed the heliopause for an imminent contact with the planet Jupiter. The purpose of the visit from these distant cousins is to witness the birth of the newest binary star in the Milky Way. The journey starts out as a marketing strategy to prove a new communication technique and turns into a rescue mission. Two thousand years ago a cloud of high-density galactic material floating within the Orion Arm of the Milky Way Galaxy overtook the solar system as it cut the galactic plane. The interaction of the cloud, the heliopause, and the outer planet Neptune marked the approach of a new age. Eager people searching for a justified existence quickly accepted the event as fulfilling the prophecies of their ancestors. The event occurred coincidentally around the time of Christ's birth. The historical impacts of the event are obvious. The concepts of Christianity began to displace older religions as the Roman Empire started to fall. There was a general sense of enlightenment, but as expected social change is difficult. Many would strive to maintain an established order against any change instead of changing for the good others. Meanwhile, the solar system continued to slice a path back and forth across the galactic plane. Thousands of years later this cloud becomes known as the Local Cloud. It is now 48,000 years later and a shock front from a super nova that defines Loop I is compressing the Local Cloud and the sun's heliopause. This unfolding event is defining the next chapter of humanity's history, where our planet's destiny becomes obvious; the social path of humanity is still a variable. We are the stewards of our environment. And yet that environment will change beyond our control. We need not stay and die. Many other species have come and gone before humanity. Can we leave in time to save ourselves? We have the free will and power to fade away or survive for a better day. Michael James Wilson is a retired electronic engineer. He has published technical papers on power conditioning techniques and the failure mechanism of components exposed to harsh electrical sources. His first published paper appeared in the Review of Scientific Instruments, July 1981. He is the principal inventor of three US patents and co-inventor of one other.

Mars,The Martian General's Daughter,Theodore Judson,2008,"Welcome to the End of Empire.Set over two hundred years from now, in a world very much like Imperial Rome, this is the story of General Peter Black, the last decent man, as told through the eyes of his devoted (and illegitimate) daughter, Justa.Raised on battlefields, more comfortable in the company of hard men of war than with women or other children, Justa must keep the truth of her birth hidden. Her father regards her as an embarrassment, a reminder of his one and only indiscretion. Yet she is a remarkable woman, one whose keen mind wins her an education at the feet of Emperor Mathias the Glistening himself.All his life, General Black served the noble emperor, and, out of loyalty to the father, continues to serve his son after Mathias's death, even as the son's reign degenerates into an insane tyranny worthy of Nero or Caligula. As the rule of the empire passes from father to son with disastrous results, a strange metal plague begins slowly destroying the empire's technology, plunging the realm into chaos and the world into war. Amid the destruction and upheaval, General Black must decide whether to turn his back on the men and institutions who never loved him nearly as much as he did them, or whether to save his most trusted ally and adviser, his best friend and only real family.The Martian General's Daughter is a gripping tale of a world at war; of cunning strategies and vile politics; of bravery, foolishness, and excess. It is at once a stirring military adventure, a cautionary tale of repeating history, a cutting satire, and a heartbreaking examination of the joys and pain inherent in the love between a father and child. Judson's previous novel was selected in multiple best-of-the-year lists. With The Martian General's Daughter, he offers another must-read epic destined to take its place in the canon of science fiction, and sure to appeal to readers of everything from Orson Scott Card to Walter M.

Mercury,Shannach - The Last: Farewell to Mars,"Leigh Brackett, Stephen Haffner, Frank Kelly Freas, Ed Emshwiller",2011,"Picking up where Lorelei of the Red Mist: Planetary Romances left off, this volume collects the final 17 stories of strange adventures on other worlds from the undisputed Queen of Space Opera. Drawn from the last years of pulp magazines such as Planet Stories, Startling Stories, and digests magazines like Venture Science Fiction, Shannach The Last: Farewell to Mars sees Brackett at the peak of her talents. Oddly, it is at this point where she abandons the planetary romance sub-genre and embarks on a small string of stories tinged with social relevance. This departure didnt stop editors asking for some of that old Brackett magic and she offered up two latter day tales (The Road to Sinharat and Purple Priestess of the Mad Moon) before returning to chronicle further adventures of Eric John Stark in her final Skaith novels. Closing out the collection is a trio of tales written on commission from the king of anthologies, Roger Elwood.Grand Master Anne McCaffrey is writing the introduction.The book proudly displays Frank Kelly Freas vintage cover art with endpapers by Ed Emshwiller from the original pulp magazines.In a review of Lorelei of the Red Mist: Planetary Romances Paul di Filippo says [Brackett's work] is replete with hard-bitten protagonists with wounded psyches, females both nurturing and malevolent, weird alien life forms, strange planetary environments, danger, treachery, camaraderie and even spiritual epiphanies. In short, this book holds the essence of SFat least, the essence of one very important school of it.Yeah, thats the stuff!",584,8818011,-0.057419355,0.474193548
Venus,Terror Out Of Space,Leigh Brackett,2011,"It was driving men to madnessâ€_ they had managed to capture it, but for how long?   Excerpt  Lundy was flying the aero-space convertible by himself. He'd been doing it for a long time. So long that the bottom half of him was dead to the toes and the top half even deader, except for two separate aches like ulcerated teeth; one in his back, one in his head.  Thick pearly-grey Venusian sky went past the speeding flier in streamers of torn cloud. The rockets throbbed and pounded. Instruments jerked erratically under the swirl of magnetic currents that makes the Venusian atmosphere such a swell place for pilots to go nuts in.  Jackie Smith was still out cold in the copilot's seat. From in back, beyond the closed door to the tiny inner cabin, Lundy could hear Farrell screaming and fighting.  He'd been screaming a long time. Ever since the shot of avertin Lundy had given him after he was taken had begun to wear thin. Fighting the straps and screaming, a hoarse jarring sound with no sense in it.  Screaming to be free, because of It.  Somewhere inside of Lundy, inside the rumpled, sweat-soaked black uniform of the Tri-World Police, Special Branch, and the five-foot-six of thick springy muscle under it, there was a knot. It was a large knot, and it was very, very cold in spite of the sweltering heat in the cabin, and it had a nasty habit of yanking itself tight every few minutes, causing Lundy to jerk and sweat as though he'd been spiked.  Lundy didn't like that cold tight knot in his belly. It meant he was afraid. He'd been afraid before, plenty of times, and he wasn't ashamed of it. But right now he needed all the brains and guts he had to get It back to Special headquarters at Vhia, and he didn't want to have to fight himself, too.  Fear can screw things for you. It can make you weak when you need to be strong, if you're going to go on living. You, and the two other guys depending on you.  Lundy hoped he could keep from getting too much afraid, and too tiredâ€”because It was sitting back there in its little strongbox in the safe, waiting for somebody to crack.  Farrell was cracked wide open, of course, but he was tied down. Jackie Smith had begun to show signs before he passed out, so that Lundy had kept one hand over the anesthetic needle gun bolstered on the side of his chair. And Lundy thought, the hell of it is, you don't know when It starts to work on you. There's no set pattern, or if there is we don't know it. Maybe right now the readings I see on those dials aren't there at all . . . .  Down below the torn grey clouds he could see occasional small patches of ocean. The black, still, tideless water of Venus, that covers so many secrets of the planet's past.  It didn't help Lundy any. It could be right or wrong, depending on what part of the ocean it wasâ€”and there was no way to tell. He hoped nothing would happen to the motors. A guy could get awfully wet, out in the middle of that still black water.  Farrell went on screaming. His throat seemed to be lined with impervium. Screaming and fighting the straps, because It was locked up and calling for help.",55,13339779,-0.101667328,0.448101852

Mercury,Valeddom - Mercury Awaits,Robert Gibson,2013,"In the grand tradition of the Golden Age of Science Fiction where we wondered at the worlds of HG Wells and Edgar Rice Burroughs, rising star Robert Gibson brings us this tale of the planet Mercury and a teenager mysteriously transported there. Hugh Dent awakes to find himself in an alien body where he has been living a parallel life as an inhabitant of Mercury - and what's more, it's the legendary, disproved, Twilight Belt version! Memories slowly return of his alternate life on this harsh world, and in the course of his adventures he meets other transplanted 'Earthminds'. Taken captive, Hugh and his friends must find a way of saving not only their own lives but also the future of Earth itself: for, terrifyingly, life on Earth is next on the list to be 'disproved' - in fact, as some readers may have noticed, the doom has begun....

Mars,A Face on Cydonia (First Contact #1),Ian J. Miller,2013,"By the year 2100 everybody, apart from some extreme recidivists, knew the so-called Face of Cydonia was simply a battered butte, and a live TV program was to poke fun at those recidivists, except that the battered butte morphed into something like the Viking image and winked. This was considered a great joke, except that nobody knew who was responsible or how it was done. Coupled with two unexplained physical measurements associated with this butte, when signals were found emanating from Epsilon Eridani, a nearby star far too young for such advanced life to have evolved, the issue of alien life arose. As a consequence, Grigori Timoshenko, Federation Commissioner for Defence and Science, is forced to form a party and settle for once and for all whether there had been alien activity around this butte.The expedition seems doomed, as there are at least three attempts to murder at least one of the party, which comprises: Fiona Bolton, an expert at sonic imaging and a well-known anti-corporate; Nathan Gill, from Theppot and who owns a registered dome near the Face; Jonathon Munro, a corporate who has been responsible for part-funding the expedition, and who wants to bypass the law and take his Corporation to Mars; and Sharon Galloway, a corporate who has developed the most advanced excavating device known.
